# COMP-307--Assignments: Principles of Web Development

A1: Create a web server using Python 3 that serves resources in a local directory (document root)
using the HTTP 1.1 protocol.
Suppose we run your web server using the following command:
python3 webserver.py 192.168.0.100 8888 /path/to/document/root
The first two arguments are the IP and port your server should listen on for incoming HTTP
requests. The third argument is the document root. 


A2: In this assignment you will create a web page that introduces yourself to the rest of the class. 


A3: In this assignment you will be creating a simple spreadsheet application using HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Start by downloading spreadsheet.html which is given to you. It is your job to implement the row button operations
using JavaScript. In addition, you must implement a row highlighting functionality.


A4: In this assignment, you will create a simple forum that allows users to create posts. Users can
sign up, log, and create posts under their username. The forum must be implemented using
PHP, with MySQL or MariaDB as the database
